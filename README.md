# Email_Sender
Currently, many email services will flag someone as spam if you send more than 100 emails a day. One work around solution to this would be to have multiple email accounts.
This project will be a simple python script I will develop that will not only send emails reading from a csv, but also send them with multiple email addresses. 
The logic is essentially to send 100 emails, then switch email address, then send 100 more emails, repeat until they're no more emails in the csv.
